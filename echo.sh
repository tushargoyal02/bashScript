# IN THIS ONE WE WILL WORK WITH ECHO AND COMMENT

# Echo is used to print whatever you have typed here
    # It will automatically let you with new line
echo "hello this is the first program"
echo "hello to second line"





# To get rid of new line use "-n": It will tell to forgot about new line
echo -n "1st line "
echo "Second line"


# To allow special character like "\n" in echo [USE -e ]

echo "\nSpecial character"

echo -e "\n special character series"


# Like below one we will do multi line comment
: 'Multi-line comment'


# To run it in the termial type
    # bash file.sh      [File extension should be sh]


echo "baba"
